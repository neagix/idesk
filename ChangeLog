Version 0.7.5
* Major bug fixes:
	- Problem with the background changer system. This it changes the background color and you still have a green background although you don't have anyone Background instructions in the .ideskrc file. The solution let you can use the Background.Delay option with 0 value to disable the background system (without delete nothing more from .ideskrc file). But if you don't have anyone Background instructions, the default value will be 0 anyway. The bug is fixed.
	- Problem with startup notification support (option --enable-libsn). The idesk-0.7.4 chrashes after starting xmms. This bug was reported by Gentoo users. If you don't have the support for statup notification the program works well. The bug is fixed.

* Minor bug fixed:
	- When you click with mouse either for reload Idesk or run a program, and you don't move the mouse of position then all icons stay with a glow effect how they had obtained the focus (all in the same time), they back to the normal state if you pass the mouse through the each icon. This bug is solved.
	- Fixed a problem with the Idesk source (configure.in file) for avoid the xlibs-dev dependencies.

Version 0.7.4
 * Features:
	- New options for Background's group. The options are:
	  + Background.File: Now the option Background.File for background image (wallpaper) works fine. (Default: None).

 * Major changes:
	- Idesk now only can run one instance in the same DISPLAY, this let avoid run two or more idesk's instances in the same DISPLAY, producing the program works bad. But if the DISPLAY is different then idesk program should run fine and run another instance.
	- Some old options changed its reache. The options Background.Delay, Background.File, Background.Mode, Background.Source, Background.Color, ToolTip.FontSize, ToolTip.FontName, ToolTip.ForeColor, ToolTip.BackColor ToolTip.CaptionOnHover, ToolTip.CaptionPlacement and  Transparency only are valid inside .ideskrc file and not inside the *.lnk icons files. The another options are valid in both types of files.
 
* Minor bug fixed:
	- Fixed a error in tooltip option that produced a blink efect when the tooltip is showed. The problem was in *.lnk files when the Width/Height attributes were omitted.

	- Fixed many other minor bugs.

 .ideskrc file example Background.File: /path_to_image/background.jpg

      others windows were open, Idesk take a "snapshot" from the current screen 
      but also take from the others windows, producing that the transparent 
      effect wasn't seen good (horrible effect produced).
