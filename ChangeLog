-----------
Version 0.7.5
* Major bug fixes:
	- Problem with the background changer system. This it changes the background color and you still have a green background although you don't have anyone Background instructions in the .ideskrc file. The solution let you can use the Background.Delay option with 0 value to disable the background system (without delete nothing more from .ideskrc file). But if you don't have anyone Background instructions, the default value will be 0 anyway. The bug is fixed.
	- Problem with startup notification support (option --enable-libsn). The idesk-0.7.4 chrashes after starting xmms. This bug was reported by Gentoo users. If you don't have the support for statup notification the program works well. The bug is fixed.

* Minor bug fixed:
	- When you click with mouse either for reload Idesk or run a program, and you don't move the mouse of position then all icons stay with a glow effect how they had obtained the focus (all in the same time), they back to the normal state if you pass the mouse through the each icon. This bug is solved.
	- Fixed a problem with the Idesk source (configure.in file) for avoid the xlibs-dev dependencies.

Version 0.7.4
 * Features:
	- New options for Background's group. The options are:
	  + Background.File: Now the option Background.File for background image (wallpaper) works fine. (Default: None).
	  + Background.Delay: Set the image change time in minutes format. (Default: 5 min). Min 1 min, Max 1440 min. (with 0 value is disable)
	  + Background.Source: Let you can define the folder where there are some images. If in the folder there aren't images or the folder didn't exist, then idesk looking for Background.File option. (Default: None).
	  + Background.Mode: Is the display mode for the images, the possible values are: Stretch, Scale, Center, Fit o Mirror). (Default: Stretch).
	  + Background.Color: Let you set the Background color if you didn't put a Background.File value or Background.Source path hadn't images. If you didn't put a Background.File and Background.Color value then the Background  is transparent and it get the background from the original Desktop background. (Default: #A2CD70).
	- Support for Esetroot pixmap (referer to bsetroot or bsetbg programs). Inside Fluxbox is very cool). It works with the new Background's wallpaper support.
	- New option value 'auto' for ToolTip.CaptionPlacement let the tooltip will be showed on left down side of icon. (Thanks to kaneda <kaneda@bohater.net>)

 * Major changes:
	- Idesk now only can run one instance in the same DISPLAY, this let avoid run two or more idesk's instances in the same DISPLAY, producing the program works bad. But if the DISPLAY is different then idesk program should run fine and run another instance.
	- Some old options changed its reache. The options Background.Delay, Background.File, Background.Mode, Background.Source, Background.Color, ToolTip.FontSize, ToolTip.FontName, ToolTip.ForeColor, ToolTip.BackColor ToolTip.CaptionOnHover, ToolTip.CaptionPlacement and  Transparency only are valid inside .ideskrc file and not inside the *.lnk icons files. The another options are valid in both types of files.
 
* Minor bug fixed:
	- Fixed a error in tooltip option that produced a blink efect when the tooltip is showed. The problem was in *.lnk files when the Width/Height attributes were omitted.
	- Fixed bug when the options Background.File and Background.Source doesnt' exist or there aren't valid PATH's for them.
	- Fixed many other minor bugs.
	  

Version 0.7.3
 * Minor bug fixed:
	- Error in Makefile.am produce a problem with the install path.
	- Bug fixed. Problem with image produced that a section of the
          icon was removed and the icon gets filled with black lines.

Version 0.7.2
 * Features:
	- Now if ${HOME}/.ideskrc file don't exist then the default ${PREFIX}/share/idesk/dot.ideskrc file is loaded with default options.
	- if ${HOME}/.idesktop files doesn't exist then the default
	  ${PREFIX}/share/idesk/default.lnk file is loaded with default options
but remember you must create the directory .idesktop.
	- New option Background.File for background image (wallpaper) in
 .ideskrc file example Background.File: /path_to_image/background.jpg
	- Optional feature for Background.File is the default folder_home.png
	  image in ${PREFIX}/share/idesk directory. If you define Background.File option and that image is invalid or it isn't exist then folder_home.png file image is loaded.

        - Now is possible define the Font, Size, Foreground and Background

 * Bug fixes:

    * Fixed the old bug for transparent effect when the user run idesk and
      others windows were open, Idesk take a "snapshot" from the current screen 
      but also take from the others windows, producing that the transparent 
      effect wasn't seen good (horrible effect produced).
